# A collection of tools for OpenAPI Initiative's Arazzo specification

Taken from https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html:
> The Arazzo Specification provides a mechanism that can define sequences of calls and their dependencies to be woven together and expressed in the context of delivering a particular outcome or set of outcomes when dealing with API descriptions (such as OpenAPI descriptions).


This repository contains some tools to help the community get started with using the Arazzo specification.
